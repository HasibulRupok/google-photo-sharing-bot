# Google Photo Sharing Bot

Google Photo Sharing Bot is a Python script that automates the process of sharing photos from Google Photos. With this bot, you can easily share your photos with specific recipients by providing the image link and the email address of the recipient.

## How It Works

The bot utilizes the `pyautogui` library to automate mouse and keyboard actions. It performs the following steps:

1. Prompts the user to click on the logged-in browser window.
2. Opens a new browser tab.
3. Navigates to the specified Google Photos image link.
4. Locates the share icon on the screen using image recognition.
5. Enters the email address of the recipient.
6. Sends the photo with an optional message.

## Usage

Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- The `pyautogui` library installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install pyautogui`.

To run the Google Photo Sharing Bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using the command: `python google_photo_sharing_bot.py`.
4. Click on the logged-in browser window when prompted.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the Google Photos image link and the recipient's email address.
6. Wait for the bot to automate the sharing process.

**Note**: It's important to understand that automating actions with `pyautogui` requires precise screen positioning, so make sure your screen is properly calibrated and the script is running on the correct screen resolution.
